# Overview
This is a sample project that demonstrates how to apply custom logic to a binding using MVVM design pattern.

# Environment
The project builds and runs with Visual Studio Community 2022 when the required workloads are installed.

# Testing
- Please see a sample called *Received.xml* in a sub-directory called *TestFiles* under the parent folder.
- Copy this file to the %temp% folder in your device (%temp% should evaluate to something like C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp). Click on *Instructions* button when you run the app and it will show you the exact path to copy it to.
- Please update the *Received.xml* file with real paths to image files from your device.
- Run the sample app.
- Once your app is running, update and save the XML file to add/remove image paths, and you should see your app view update dynamically.
